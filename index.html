Breaking: New database tracks books translated into English from other languages
University of Rochester’s Professor Chad Post said he built the database to address the 'cultural insularity' of Americans
By Campbell Gulbrandsen, JNL221
A new database at the University of Rochester in New York shows how many of the English-language books available to Americans today were originally written in a different language. The data, which collects the title of the book, the author and translator’s names and genders, and the language of the original book, among other things, is continuously updated and goes back to 2008.
In an article on Vulture, database maintainer Chad Post explained what publishers call the ‘three percent problem’ -- that less than three percent of books in English were originally written in a different language. Post asserts that this lack of diversity in literature available to Americans results in stunted growth among American readers and writers.
“Although American fiction is neither bad nor withering, there is a lurking suspicion among a lot of writers, readers, and professors that without international literature, we end up writing the same things in the same ways over and over again,” said Post in his Vulture article.
Containing more than 8,000 entries as of September, the database grows by authors and translator adding their projects to it, and by Post hand-entering works into it based on publishers’ catalogs, according to the project’s website. JNL221 did a deep-dive analysis of the database.
TK CHART GROUP ONE TK: Between 2008 and 2020, there was a 47% increase of books translated. Between 2011 and 2012 alone, there was an increase of more than 400 books translated. Since 2018, the number of books being translated has been declining.
TK CHART GROUP TWO TK: For the languages with the most translations, like Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Russian, there seemed to be a peak in 2012 and 2013 of translations published, after which there was a steady decline.
TK CHART GROUP THREE TK: For languages where both male and female authors were translated, the vast majority of books translated were by male authors. For many, more than three times as many men were translated than women.
TK CHART GROUP FOUR TK: Overall, fiction is the most translated genre. For every country that had all four genres translated -- poetry, fiction, non-fiction and children’s books -- fiction translations beat out every other translated genre.
