		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>

	
		<h3>Women's Pockets, The Pudding:</h3>
		<ul>

		</ul>
		<p>The key message in this dataviz project is to show the discrepancy of men’s and women’s pant pocket sizes. The data is sourced from measurements of men’s and women’s jean pockets from various popular denim brands. For each brand analyzed, a size 32 women and men’s straight and skinny jeans were used. Measurements of common objects such as pens, smartphones, wallets, and women’s and men’s hands were compared to each pocket size using dataviz elements. The visuals are integrated within breaks in the text and appear when the viewer scrolls further down the page.</p>
		<p>The writers used side by side graphics to compare the women’s pockets to the men’s pockets of various brands. Viewers can also select different brands from a drop down menu to see the visuals and compare different brands. This project is effective in conveying its message because they use realistic visuals of pant pockets to compare the data. In addition, they present the data in a very clean and self explanatory way so viewers can easily interpret the data without needing much context.</p>
		<p>This data represents visceral dataviz, in terms of Mona Chalabi, through concrete visuals of the difference and practicality of men’s and women’s pocket sizes. For example, one visual within the dataviz allows readers to interact with the data by comparing the size of real life items to the gendered pockets such as various smartphones or everyday items. It is clear that the men’s pockets are larger and more practical for their purpose. In addition, using different common brands helps the viewer connect the story to their personal favorite denim brand. The story also provides historical context for why women’s pockets are much smaller. Overall, this data helps readers connect to the reality of a problem that most women face when wearing denim, and the lack of practicality the fashion industry has denoted to women’s pockets.</p>
